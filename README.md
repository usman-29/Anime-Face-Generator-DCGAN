# Anime Face Generation using DCGAN

This repository contains an implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate anime-style face images. The project is built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on a dataset of anime face images.

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of neural network architecture designed for generating realistic data. A GAN consists of two networks:

- **Generator**: Generates new data instances (anime faces) from random noise. It learns to create images that are similar to the dataset by trying to fool the discriminator.
- **Discriminator**: Classifies images as real (from the dataset) or fake (generated by the generator). It learns to distinguish between real and generated images.

The two networks are trained in an adversarial manner, where the generator aims to improve the quality of its generated images, and the discriminator becomes better at detecting fake images.

## Dataset

The anime faces dataset is used for training and is located at: `/kaggle/input/anime-faces`. It contains a collection of anime-style face images suitable for generative modeling.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
